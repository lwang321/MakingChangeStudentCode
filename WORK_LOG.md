I tried to figure this problem out first by solving small case on my own. I tried making a combination of 5 cents with 1, 2, and 3 cent denominations. This problem can be solved in 5 ways: 5 * 1, 2 * 2 + 1 * 1, 2 * 1 + 1 * 3, 3+2, and 3+2 * 1. I first tried thinking about solving this through the lens of finding the most optimal substructure. In this example, there are two possible examples of what I could use for the smallest substructure. 1) I can use coins, for example, figure out how many ways I can make 5 with 1 and 2, then use that answer to figure out the combinations using 1, 2, and 3. Or 2) I could go by total amount, for example figure out how many combinations can make up 1 cent, then 2 cents, and so on. I think going by the coins makes a bit more sense but I'm not sure how to code it up yet. |
| Jan 25 | 9-10:30pm  | I thought a lot about this problem and I may have a solution. Here's my proposed algorithm: let's build off subcases of the number of coins. For example, let's make 5 cents with denominations of 1, 2, and 3. The number of ways I can make 5 cents with only coins of 1 is 1; then, the number of ways I can make 5 cents with 2 coins (1 and 2) is the number of ways I can do it with coin 2 plus the number of ways I can do it without coin 2. Then, the number of ways I can do it with coin 2 is equal to the number of ways I can make 5-2 without coin 2 + the number of ways I can make 5-2*2 without coin 2. Thus, we can save from recalculating because each case (adding on a new denomination) is built off the last subcase. Time to code this solution and hopefully it works. However, I'm currently stuck on the part where I code the how many ways I can make 5 with both coins 1 and 2 in play. I think it might have to do with some kind of recursion: we can figure out the number of ways to make 5 with 1 and 2 using the number of ways to make 3 with 1 and 2, which is also dependent on the number of ways to make 1 with 1 and 2. That number goes from 1 way (1x1) to 2 ways (111, 12) to 3 ways (11111, 122, 1112). However, this would go back to the other solution, which would be subproblem optimization based on target value. I could try that next, but I'm not sure how to go about that, other than a brute force method of recurse through whether or not I want to use every coin at every turn, which would be way to big for the solution. |

Memoization works through recursion by breaking the problem into optimal subproblems. I was slightly right in my v1 where I split each case into include and exclude. However, I gave up after realizing that I had to also calculate based on coin value for include. The final solution is as following: for any given set of coins and target, that is equal to the include case (keep the coin in the set, subtract coin value from target) + the exclude case (subtract the coin from the set, keep the value the same. We can track this in a table, and sometimes we will recalculate the same value. Thus, after calculating any case, we store it in the table, which saves lots of recalculation. |

Tabulation is the opposite of memoization, where memoization is top down, and tabulation is bottom up. Instead of going from the target value to the edges of the table recursively, we start in the top left and iteratively fill out the table. This approach is faster than memoization theoretically because recursion is costly for memory due to the call stack, and usually having to juggle lots of memory slows down a program. I did find this to be true, with a memoizatoin runtime of around 30ms and tabulation runtime of around 20ms (the test cases are both small so it could just be random difference). |
